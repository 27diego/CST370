1. Initialize an empty minimum spanning tree (set of edges). O(1)
2. Initialize a map of nodes to node-integer pairs (shortest edge connecting that node to the MST and its length). Insert all nodes and set their values to (nullptr, infinity). O(1)
3. Iterate over the number of nodes in the graph: O(V)
    1. Pick the node closest to the MST (i.e., node with min distance in the map). O(V)
    2. If the node is not the first node (i.e., the edge is not nullptr) add the edge to the MST. O(1)
    3. Remove the node from the map. O(1)
    4. Iterate over the node’s neighbors. O(d)
    5. If the neighbor is in the map and this edge is shorter than the one in the map, update the neighbor’s value. O(1)
4. Return the MST. O(1)
